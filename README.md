# Loan-Approval-Prediction-Problem
Loans are the core business of banks. The main profit comes directly from the loan’s interest. The loan companies grant a loan after an intensive process of verification and validation. However, they still don’t have assurance if the applicant is able to repay the loan with no difficulties. In this project, we’ll build a predictive model to predict if an applicant is able to repay the lending company or not. We work on the dataset that has been provided by Kaggle and we are going to use various models to predict the target variable.
